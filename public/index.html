        <p>Bad news, due to a hardware failure Santa has lost the <em>Naughty or Nice</em> list.</p>
        <p>It seems that all data, the names, the addresses, everything got lost!</p>
        <img src="casette.png" />
        <p>Our last hope is in some BASF casettes now, that might contain at least parts of the list.
            Unfortunately, the elves don't possess the necessary hardware to load it anymore, but somebody
            out there might be able to help.
        </p>
        <p>We have managed to digitise the contents of the casettes, <a href="input.txt">your puzzle input</a>.</p> 
        <p>Each row of your input contains a 4ms long section of the audio on the tape, numbers are between <em>-128</em> and <em>127</em>. According
            to the old Datasette manual the casette stores a sequence of <em>1000</em>, <em>2000</em> and <em>3000Hz</em> audio samples to encode the digits 
            <em>0</em>, <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> respectively.
        </p>
        <p>According to the manual the tape contains ASCII text. Each character is encoded separately and uses <em>8 ternary digits</em> of 
            the input.</p>
        <p>The representation is in <em>base 3</em>, for example <em>"10"</em> means decimal <em>3</em>, <em>"21"</em> is decimal <em>7</em>.</p> 
        <p>Each character consists of a leading 0, five data digits and two closing digits 1 and 2 like: <em>0ddddd12</em>.
        <p>The first data digit is the most significant one (MSB order).</p>
        <p>Please try to recover whatever you can, and if you like the puzzle let others know about it.</p>
